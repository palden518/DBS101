## General objective of the Module

This module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of database systems, covering fundamental concepts to advanced topics essential for database practitioners. Through a structured approach, it aims to familiarise students with the theoretical foundations, practical methodologies, and techniques in database design, implementation, and management. By delving into relational/non-relational models and key-value caches, SQL query languages, storage structures, indexing methods, and query optimization, students will gain a holistic view of database systems. Moreover, the module endeavours to instil proficiency in transaction management, concurrency control, and recovery mechanisms, enabling students to address real-world challenges in ensuring data integrity, consistency, and reliability. Overall, this module seeks to prepare students with the necessary skills and knowledge to design, implement, and administer robust database solutions in diverse technological landscapes.

## Assessment Approach

- ### Class Quizzes (20%)
  - #### Students will take two in-class closed book quizzes during the 3rd  and 9th weeks.
  - ### Class Quiz I (10%)
     - In the 4th week is a closed-book quiz that will last for 1 hour and will evaluate their comprehension of the theoretical concepts related to the learning outcomes I - III and is covered in the units:
     - Unit I: Introduction to Database Systems
     - Unit II: Database Design
     - Unit III: Introduction to SQL
     - Unit IV: Intermediate and Advanced SQL	
  - ### Class Quiz II (10%)
    - In the 9th week is a closed-book examination that will last for 1 hour and will evaluate their comprehension of the theoretical concepts related to the learning outcomes IV-VI and is covered in the units:
    - Unit V : Relational Database Design
    - Unit VI : Non Relational Databases
    - Unit VII: Database Storage Structures
    - Unit VIII : Indexing

- ### Practical Assignment: (30%)
  - #### Over 13 weeks (Weeks 2-15), student groups of 3-4 will design a database and implement optimizations demonstrating best practices in database design, performance tuning, and reliable recovery. This continuous assessment will cover all learning outcomes and content from Units Iâ€“XIII.
  - #### In the 2nd week, groups will submit a business process based on which they will design their database. The assignment has 2 stages with distinct requirements:

  #### Stage 1(Week 4)- Database Design (10%)
  - Students will design a database tailored to the business process their group selected.
  - The students will be assessed based on their understanding of the learning outcomes I - II which are covered in the units I - II.
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Relevance to the business process		- 2.0%
    - Appropriate entity relationship diagram	- 8.0%


  #### Stage 2 (Week 13) - Implementation (20%)
  - Students will implement their database design using relational or non-relational databases.
  - The students will be assessed based on their understanding of the learning outcomes III-VII and are covered in units: III - XII
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
  - Accuracy of table schemas compared to design	- 5.0%
    - Inserting appropriate test data			- 5.0%
    - Demonstrating basic CRUD queries			- 5.0%
    - Data integrity constraints enforcement		- 2.0%
    - Data querying methods and sample outputs		- 3.0%

- ### Lab Practical: (40%)
  - Students will submit lab reports for each practical session.  The report will be assessed every week. Each lab report will be graded out of 40 marks, the total marks will be cumulative for all submissions. The final total will be converted to an overall 40% of the grade.
  - This continuous assessment will cover all of the learning outcomes and topics covered in units I - XIII.
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Timely Submission 				- 5.0%
    - Technical correctness				- 10.0%
    - Completion of lab tasks			- 15.0%
    - Explanation clarity and language		- 5.0%
    - Summary analysis identifying key lessons 	- 5.0%

- ### Flipped Classroom Journals: (10%)
  - Students must actively participate in Flipped Class lessons and submit a reflective journal entry for each unit (12 units total). Each journal will be graded out of 10 marks, cumulative across the 12 entries. The final total will be converted to an overall 10% of the grade.
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Concept Exposition 		- 5.0%
    - Language Clarity 		- 5.0%
