## General objective of the Module

This module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of database systems, covering fundamental concepts to advanced topics essential for database practitioners. Through a structured approach, it aims to familiarise students with the theoretical foundations, practical methodologies, and techniques in database design, implementation, and management. By delving into relational/non-relational models and key-value caches, sequential query languages(SQL), indexing methods, and query optimization, students will gain a holistic view of database systems.

## Assessment Approach

### Mid-Term Test (10%)
 
- In the 4th week is a closed-book quiz that will last for 1 hour and will evaluate their comprehension of the theoretical concepts related to the learning outcomes I - III and is covered in the units:
 - Unit I: Introduction to Database Systems
 - Unit II: Database Design
 - Unit III: Introduction to SQL
 - Unit IV: Intermediate and Advanced SQL	

### Class Quiz (10%)
- In the 10th week is a closed-book examination that will last for 1 hour and will evaluate their comprehension of the theoretical concepts related to 70% of the syllabus and is covered in the units:
  - Unit I: Introduction to Database Systems
  - Unit II: Database Design
  - Unit III: Introduction to SQL
  - Unit IV: Intermediate and Advanced SQL 
  - Unit V : Relational Database Design
  - Unit VI: Indexing and Query Processing
	
  

### Practical Assignment: (30%)
  #### Over 13 weeks (Weeks 2-15), student groups of 3-4 will design a database and implement optimizations demonstrating best practices in database design, performance tuning, and reliable recovery. This continuous assessment will cover all learning outcomes and content from Units Iâ€“XIII.
  - #### In the 2nd week, groups will submit a business process based on which they will design their database. The assignment has 2 stages with distinct requirements:

  #### Stage 1(Week 4)- Database Design (10%)
  - Students will design a database tailored to the business process their group selected.
  - The students will be assessed based on their understanding of the learning outcomes I - II which are covered in the units I - II.
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Timely Submission 				- 2.0%
    - Appropriate entity relationship diagram	- 8.0%


  #### Stage 2 (Week 13) - Implementation (20%)
  - Students will implement their database design using relational databases and will do a presentation on their work.
  - The students will be assessed based on their understanding of the learning outcomes III-IX and are covered in units: III - VI
  - The report will be assessed on the following criteria: 
    - Report Quality(organisation, clarity of writing) 	- 4.0%
    - Content						- 4.0%
    - Timely Submission					- 2.0%

  - The presentation will be assessed on the following criteria:
  - Accuracy of table schemas compared to design	- 2.0%
  - Appropriateness of  test data				- 2.0%
  - Demonstration of  basic CRUD queries		- 3.0%
  - Data querying methods and sample outputs		- 5.0%	


- ### Laboratory Reports: (40%)
  - Students will submit lab reports for each practical session.  The report will be assessed every week. Each lab report will be graded out of 40 marks, the total marks will be cumulative for all submissions. The final total will be converted to an overall 40% of the grade.
  - This continuous assessment will cover all of the learning outcomes and topics covered in units I - VI.
  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Timely Submission 					- 5.0%
    - Report Quality(Organisation, Clarity of writing)	- 10.0%
    - Completion of l tasks					- 20.0%
    - Summary analysis identifying key lessons 		- 5.0%

- ### Flipped Classroom Journals: (10%)
  - Students will maintain a personal website where they will be required to write blog posts on module content for each unit. They will actively participate in updating the blogs after the completion of each unit in class. Each blog post will be graded out of 10 marks, cumulative across the 9 entries. The final total will be converted to an overall 10% of the grade. The following criteria will be used to assess them.

  - This continuous assessment will be assessed based on the following criteria:
    - Concept Exposition 		- 5.0%
    - Language Clarity 		- 5.0%
