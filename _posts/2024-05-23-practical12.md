# Guided Session

## Transactions 

```javascript
CREATE DATABASE transaction_demo;
```
```javascript
\c transaction_demo
```
```javascript
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```
### Transaction Operations

```javascript
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 70000);
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';
COMMIT;
```
#### Advanced Usage with Savepoints

A SAVEPOINT in transactions is a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back without affecting the preceding operations. Savepoints allow you to partially undo a transaction, making it easier to handle errors or perform complex operations that might require temporary checkpoints within the same transaction.

Key Features of Savepoints

- Nested Transactions: Savepoints provide a way to create nested transactions within a larger transaction.
- Error Handling: They enable more granular control over error handling by allowing rollback to a specific savepoint rather than aborting the entire transaction.
- Complex Operations: Useful in complex operations where intermediate states need to be validated or modified without committing the entire transaction.

```javascript
BEGIN;
SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('Tom Brown', 'Data Analyst', 65000);
SAVEPOINT savepoint2;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.05 WHERE name = 'Tom Brown';
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
Note: Tom Brown, Data Analyst, 71662.50 is added as an entry to the table

#### Rollback to first savepoint: 

```javascript
ROLLBACK TO savepoint1;
SELECT * FROM employees;
COMMIT;
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
Note: Tom Brown, Data Analyst, 71662.50 is is removed from table

## Concurrency Control
### Isolation Levels

Four Standard Isolation Levels in PostgreSQL
- Read Uncommitted:
  Description: The lowest isolation level. Transactions can read changes made by other transactions even if they haven't been committed yet.
  Issues: This level can result in dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
  Usage: Rarely used in practice due to potential data integrity issues.
  
- Read Committed (default level in PostgreSQL):
  Description: A transaction only sees changes that were committed before it began. It will not see any uncommitted changes from other transactions.
  Issues: Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
  Usage: Commonly used for its balance between performance and consistency.
  
- Repeatable Read:
  Description: Ensures that if a transaction reads a row, subsequent reads will see the same data during the transaction. Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
  Issues: Can still encounter phantom reads, where new rows matching a query condition appear if another transaction inserts them after the initial read.
  Usage: Suitable for transactions that require a higher level of consistency without needing full serializability.

- Serializable:
  Description: The highest isolation level, which emulates serial transaction execution. Transactions are completely isolated from each other, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
  Issues: This level can lead to higher contention and reduced performance due to locking and potential deadlocks.
  Usage: Used when complete isolation is necessary, such as in financial transactions.

```javascript
CREATE DATABASE bankdb;
\c bankdb
```

```javascript
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    balance NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

```javascript
INSERT INTO accounts (name, balance) VALUES ('Alice', 1000.00), ('Bob', 1000.00);
```
- Open two terminals(Session 1, Session 2) and login to your postgresql server, then use bankdb

-  #### Read Committed

Session 1

```javascript
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';
```
Session 2

```javascript
BEGIN;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; 
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;

SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
```


Back to Session 1

-- Session 1 reads Alice's balance again, it still returns the original amount (does not see Session 2's update)

```javascript
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
COMMIT;
```
-  #### Repeatable Read

Session 1

-- Session 1 reads Alice's balance
-- Simulate some delay
-- Do not commit or rollback yet

```javascript
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; 
```
Session 2

-- Session 2 reads Alice's balance
-- Session 2 updates Alice's balance
-- Session 2 commits the changes

```javascript
BEGIN;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
```
Back to Session 1

-- Session 1 reads Alice's balance again it still returns the previous value (does not see Session 2's update)

```javascript
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
-  #### Serializable

Session 1

-- Session 1 reads Alice's balance
-- Simulate some delay
-- Do not commit or rollback yet

```javascript
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; 
```
Session 2

-- Session 2 reads Alice's balance
-- Session 2 updates Alice's balance
-- Session 2 commits the changes

```javascript
BEGIN;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice';  
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'; 
```

Back to Session 1

-- Session 1 tries to update Alice's balance
-- Fails with serialization error

```javascript
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE name = 'Alice'; 
COMMIT;
```

### Locking

Database locking in PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and consistency by preventing concurrent transactions from interfering with each other. Locks can be applied at different levels, such as rows, tables, or even the entire database, depending on the type of operation being performed.

Types of Locks in PostgreSQL
1. Row-Level Locks: Locks individual rows in a table.
- Exclusive Lock: Acquired for operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- Share Lock: Acquired when rows are selected with FOR SHARE.

2. Table-Level Locks: Locks entire tables.
- Access Share Lock: Acquired by SELECT queries.
- Row Share Lock: Acquired by SELECT ... FOR UPDATE.
- Row Exclusive Lock: Acquired by INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT ... FOR UPDATE.
- Share Lock: Acquired by CREATE INDEX.
- Share Row Exclusive Lock: Acquired by REFERENCES.
- Exclusive Lock: Acquired by ALTER TABLE.
- Access Exclusive Lock: Acquired by DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, REINDEX, and other schema-altering commands.

```javascript
CREATE DATABASE lockdemo;
\c lockdemo
```
```javascript
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```
```javascript
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES 
('Alice Smith', 'Manager', 90000.00),
('Bob Johnson', 'Developer', 80000.00),
('Carol White', 'Designer', 70000.00);
```

#### Row-Level Locks
Open Session 1(Terminal 1) and acquire an exclusive lock on a row:

-- This locks the row with id=1
```javascript
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 1;
```
Open Session 2(Terminal 2) and try to update the same row:

```javascript
\c lockdemo
```

-- This will block until Session 1 commits or rolls back
-- It will only BEGIN transaction and no updates will be made until the deadlock is solved

```javascript
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.2 WHERE id = 1;
```
Open Session 1 and then commit

```javascript
COMMIT;
```
Look at session 2, it  will proceed once the lock is released.

#### Table-Level Locks

Open Session 1 and acquire a table-level lock:

-- This prevents exclusive locks but allows other shared locks 

```javascript
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE employees IN SHARE MODE;
```
Open Session 2 and try to acquire an exclusive lock on the same table:

-- This will block until Session 1 commits or rolls back

```javascript
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE employees IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
```

Commit or Rollback Session 1 to release the lock:

```javascript
COMMIT;  -- or ROLLBACK;
```
Session 2 will proceed once the lock is released; i.e; Session 2 will not be able to lock the resource until it is released.

#### Using Explicit Locking in SQL Queries

- ###### SELECT FOR UPDATE: Acquires a row-level exclusive lock.

-- This locks the row with id=1 for update
```javascript
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
COMMIT;
```

- ###### SELECT FOR SHARE: Acquires a row-level share lock.

-- This locks the row with id=1 for reading
```javascript
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1 FOR SHARE;
COMMIT;
```

- ###### Explicit Table Locking: Acquires table-level locks.

-- This prevents other transactions from acquiring locks on the table

```javascript
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE employees IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
COMMIT;
```

#### Handling Deadlocks
A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks. PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlocks and resolves them by aborting one of the transactions.

## Database Recovery

Database recovery using logs in PostgreSQL is primarily managed through Write-Ahead Logging (WAL). WAL ensures data integrity and durability by recording changes to a log before applying them to the database. This mechanism allows PostgreSQL to recover from crashes and ensures that committed transactions are not lost.

Key Concepts of WAL
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging): Every change to the database is first written to a WAL file (also called a transaction log) before being applied to the actual data files. This ensures that if a crash occurs, PostgreSQL can use the WAL to replay the changes and recover the database to a consistent state.

- WAL Files: WAL files are binary files that store the log records. By default, they are located in the pg_wal directory within the data directory.

- Checkpoint: A checkpoint is a point in the transaction log sequence at which all data files have been updated to reflect the information in the log. Checkpoints help in speeding up the recovery process.

- Archiving: For long-term retention and backup purposes, WAL files can be archived to a separate location using archive mode.
