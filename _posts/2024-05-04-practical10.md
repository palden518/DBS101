## B+ Trees
### Insertion
Inserting a new value into a B+ tree follows these steps:
- Search for the Leaf Node: Start from the root and traverse down the tree to find the appropriate leaf node where the new value should be inserted.
- Insertion into Leaf Node: Insert the new value into the leaf node in a sorted order. If the leaf node overflows, split it into two nodes and promote the middle value to the parent node.
- Propagate Changes Upwards: If the parent node of the leaf node overflows due to the split, apply the same splitting process recursively until the root if necessary.

Example, Let's say we have a B+ tree with an order of 3:
- Inserting 8 into the tree:
  - Traverse down to the leaf node containing values 7 and 9, then insert 8 between them.
  - If the leaf node overflows, split it and promote the middle value (8) to the parent node.

### Deletion
Deleting a value from a B+ tree involves:
- Search for the Value: Traverse down the tree to find the leaf node containing the value to be deleted.
- Delete from Leaf Node: Remove the value from the leaf node. If the node underflows, borrow a value from adjacent nodes or merge nodes.
- Propagate Changes Upwards: Update parent nodes if necessary due to underflow.

Example:
- Deleting 4 from the B+ tree:
  - Traverse down to the leaf node containing 4 and remove it.
  - If the leaf node underflows, borrow a value from an adjacent node or merge nodes.

### Updation
Updating a value in a B+ tree combines deletion and insertion:
- Delete the Old Value: Follow the deletion process to remove the old value from the tree.
- Insert the New Value: Insert the new value into the tree using the insertion process.

Example:
- Updating 6 to 10 in the B+ tree:
  - Delete 6 from the tree.
  - Insert 10 into the tree.


#### Code Example:

```javascript
class BPlusTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, is_leaf=False):
        self.keys = []
        self.children = []
        self.is_leaf = is_leaf
        self.next_leaf = None
    
    def add_key(self, key):
        self.keys.append(key)
        self.keys.sort()

    def split(self):
        split_index = len(self.keys) // 2
        new_node = BPlusTreeNode(self.is_leaf)
        new_node.keys = self.keys[split_index:]
        self.keys = self.keys[:split_index]
        if not self.is_leaf:
            new_node.children = self.children[split_index:]
            self.children = self.children[:split_index]
        return new_node

class BPlusTree:
    def __init__(self, order):
        self.root = BPlusTreeNode(is_leaf=True)
        self.order = order
    
    def insert(self, key):
        print(f"Inserting {key} into the tree:")
        leaf_node = self.find_leaf_node(self.root, key)
        leaf_node.add_key(key)
        print(f"Inserted {key} into leaf node: {leaf_node.keys}")
        if len(leaf_node.keys) > self.order:
            print(f"Leaf node overflow, splitting leaf node {leaf_node.keys}")
            self.split_leaf_node(leaf_node)
    
    def find_leaf_node(self, node, key):
        if node.is_leaf:
            return node
        index = 0
        while index < len(node.keys) and key > node.keys[index]:
            index += 1
        return self.find_leaf_node(node.children[index], key)
    
    def split_leaf_node(self, node):
        new_node = node.split()
        new_node.next_leaf = node.next_leaf
        node.next_leaf = new_node
        print(f"Split leaf node: {node.keys} -> {new_node.keys}")
    
    def delete(self, key):
        print(f"Deleting {key} from the tree:")
        self.delete_recursive(self.root, key)
    
    def delete_recursive(self, node, key):
        if node.is_leaf:
            if key in node.keys:
                node.keys.remove(key)
                print(f"Deleted {key} from leaf node: {node.keys}")
            else:
                print(f"Key {key} not found in the tree.")
        else:
            index = 0
            while index < len(node.keys) and key > node.keys[index]:
                index += 1
            self.delete_recursive(node.children[index], key)
    
    def update(self, old_key, new_key):
        print(f"Updating {old_key} to {new_key} in the tree:")
        self.delete(old_key)
        self.insert(new_key)

# Example usage:
bplus_tree = BPlusTree(order=3)
values_to_insert = [8, 4, 10, 6, 7, 9]
for value in values_to_insert:
    bplus_tree.insert(value)

bplus_tree.delete(4)
bplus_tree.update(6, 11)
```


### B+ Tree Multilevel Indexing
B+ tree multilevel indexing involves using multiple levels of B+ trees to index large datasets efficiently.

Example:

Consider a scenario where a single B+ tree cannot fit all the data in memory. Instead, we use multiple B+ trees, where each node of the root tree points to another B+ tree. This creates a hierarchy of B+ trees, enabling efficient indexing of large datasets while minimizing memory usage.

```javascript
class Node:
    def __init__(self, leaf=False):
        self.keys = []
        self.children = []
        self.leaf = leaf

class BPlusTree:
    def __init__(self, degree):
        self.root = Node(leaf=True)
        self.degree = degree

    def insert(self, key):
        if key in self.root.keys:
            print("Key already exists")
            return

        if len(self.root.keys) == (2 * self.degree) - 1:
            new_root = Node()
            new_root.children.append(self.root)
            self.split(new_root, 0)
            self.root = new_root
        self._insert(self.root, key)

    def _insert(self, node, key):
        if node.leaf:
            node.keys.append(key)
            node.keys.sort()
        else:
            i = 0
            while i < len(node.keys) and key > node.keys[i]:
                i += 1
            if len(node.children[i].keys) == (2 * self.degree) - 1:
                self.split(node, i)
                if key > node.keys[i]:
                    i += 1
            self._insert(node.children[i], key)

    def split(self, parent, index):
        node_to_split = parent.children[index]
        new_node = Node(leaf=node_to_split.leaf)
        parent.keys.insert(index, node_to_split.keys[self.degree - 1])
        parent.children.insert(index + 1, new_node)
        new_node.keys = node_to_split.keys[self.degree:]
        node_to_split.keys = node_to_split.keys[:self.degree - 1]
        if not node_to_split.leaf:
            new_node.children = node_to_split.children[self.degree:]
            node_to_split.children = node_to_split.children[:self.degree]

    def search(self, key):
        return self._search(self.root, key)

    def _search(self, node, key):
        if key in node.keys:
            return True
        elif node.leaf:
            return False
        else:
            i = 0
            while i < len(node.keys) and key > node.keys[i]:
                i += 1
            return self._search(node.children[i], key)

# Example usage:
bptree = BPlusTree(3)  # Creating a B+ tree with degree 3
keys = [10, 20, 5, 6, 12, 30, 7]

for key in keys:
    bptree.insert(key)

print(bptree.search(6))  # Output: True
print(bptree.search(15))  # Output: False
```
This is a basic implementation and might not cover all the edge cases and optimizations typically found in a production-level B+ tree implementation.

## Write optimized indexed structures

One of the drawbacks of the B+-tree index structure is that its performance can be poor with random writes. If the index is too large to fit in memory and writes or inserts are done in an order that does not match the sort order of the index, each write/insert is likely to touch a different leaf node. If the number of leaf nodes is significantly larger than the buffer size, most of these leaf accesses would require a random read operation, as well as a subsequent write operation to write the updated leaf page back to disk. On a system with a magnetic disk, this can lead to a very low write/insert rate due to the high access time. Even on systems with faster SSDs, page writes still have a significant cost due to the expensive page erase operation. Therefore, the basic B+-tree structure is not ideal for applications that need to support a very large number of random writes/inserts per second.

Several alternative index structures have been proposed to handle workloads with
a high write/insert rate. The log-structured merge tree or LSM tree and its variants are
write-optimized index structures that have seen very significant adoption. The buffer
tree is an alternative approach, which can be used with a variety of search tree structures.


- Propose any index structure with high write/insert rate.
- Explain how these index structures are a better alternative.
- Implement the index structure using python.
