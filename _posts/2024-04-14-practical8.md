# Guided Session

## Retrieve the number of databases
```javascript
CONFIG GET databases
```
Output:
```javascript
1) "databases"
2) "16"
```
This indicates that there are 16 databases available in the Redis instance.

The default configuration of Redis typically includes 16 databases (numbered from 0 to 15), but this value can be adjusted in the Redis configuration file (redis.conf). Additionally, some managed Redis services may have different default configurations.

## Selecting a Database
```javascript
Select 0
```

## Deleting/Flushing from database

This command deletes all keys from the currently selected database.
```javascript
FLUSHDB
```
This command deletes all keys from all databases in the Redis instance.
```javascript
FLUSHALL
```


## Student Information Management System
Consider a Student Information Management System; as redis does not follow table structure we can consider the following schema for our database.

A student record in the database will have the following attributes:
- student_id: Unique ID of the student, internal to this database
- name: The name of the student
- age: Age of the student
- grade: Grade level of the student (e.g., 10th, 11th, 12th)
- GPA: Grade Point Average of the student (numerical value)
- attendance: Percentage of attendance
- address: Address of the student
- contact: Contact number of the student
- email: Email address of the student

### Task 1: Insert data

```javascript
HSET student:001 name "John Doe" age 17 grade "11th" GPA 3.8 attendance 95 address "123 Main St, City" contact "123-456-7890" email "john.doe@example.com"
HSET student:002 name "Alice Smith" age 16 grade "10th" GPA 3.5 attendance 92 address "456 Oak Ave, Town" contact "987-654-3210" email "alice.smith@example.com"
HSET student:003 name "Michael Johnson" age 18 grade "12th" GPA 4.0 attendance 98 address "789 Elm St, Village" contact "555-123-4567" email "michael.johnson@example.com"
HSET student:004 name "Emily Brown" age 17 grade "11th" GPA 3.7 attendance 94 address "101 Pine Rd, County" contact "222-333-4444" email "emily.brown@example.com"
HSET student:005 name "David Wilson" age 16 grade "10th" GPA 3.2 attendance 90 address "777 Cedar Ln, Suburb" contact "777-888-9999" email "david.wilson@example.com"
```

### Task 2: Retrieve Data
```javascript
HMGET student
```
```javascript
HMGET student:001
```
```javascript
HMGET student:001 name GPA
```
### Task 3: Indexes
- Creating an Index
```javascript
FT.CREATE idx:student ON hash PREFIX 1 "student:" SCHEMA name TEXT SORTABLE age NUMERIC SORTABLE grade TAG SORTABLE GPA NUMERIC SORTABLE attendance NUMERIC SORTABLE address TEXT contact TEXT email TEXT
```
- Using the Index
```javascript
FT.INFO idx:student
```
- List Indexes
Get a list of all RediSearch indexes in the database.
```javascript
FT._LIST
```
- Inspect Index Information:
Get detailed information about the index.
```javascript
FT.INFO "idx:student"
```
- Update Index Definition:
Add a new field to the index using the FT.ALTER command.
```javascript
FT.ALTER idx:student SCHEMA ADD address TEXT
```
Run a query on the new indexed field
```javascript
FT.SEARCH idx:student "123 Main St" RETURN 2 name address
```
- Drop index
```javascript
FT.DROPINDEX idx:student
```
- Verify Indexed Documents
Verify that the indexed documents are still present in the database after dropping the index.
```javascript
SCAN 0 MATCH student:*
```

### Task 4: Searching in redis

- Search for all students whose name contains "John":
  ```javascript
  FT.SEARCH idx:student "John"
  ```
- Limit the query to return only the name and grade of the students:
  ```javascript
  FT.SEARCH idx:student "John" RETURN 2 name grade
  ```
- Search for students in 10th grade:
  ```javascript
  FT.SEARCH idx:student "@grade:{10th}"
  ```
- Query students with GPA higher than 3.5:
  ```javascript
  FT.SEARCH idx:student "@GPA:[3.5 +inf]"
  ```
- Search for students living in a specific city (e.g., "City"):
  ```javascript
  FT.SEARCH idx:student "City" RETURN 2 name address
  ```
### Task 5: Updating, Counting and Deleting fields

- Updating entry
  - Single field: Let's say we want to update the GPA of a student with ID "student:001" from 3.5 to 3.7.
    ```javascript
    HSET student:001 GPA 3.7
    ```
  - Multiple fields: Let's say we want to update both the GPA and attendance fields of the student with ID "student:001".
    ```javascript
    HMSET student:001 GPA 3.7 attendance 95
    ```
- Count
  - Count the number of existing students in the database.
    ```javascript
    FT.SEARCH idx:student "*" LIMIT 0 0
    ```
- Delete 
  - Delete a student record
    ```javascript
    DEL student:005
    ```
  - Verify deletion 
    ```javascript
    FT.SEARCH idx:student 005 RETURN 2 name grade
    ```
- Expire a record
  - Set a time to live (TTL) for a student's record to automatically expire.
   ```javascript
   EXPIRE "student:004" 30
   ```
  - Verify that the student's record has expired after the specified time.
   ```javascript
   FT.SEARCH idx:student "David Wilson" RETURN 2 name grade
   ```
### Task 6: Aggregation
- Calculate Average GPA:
```javascript
ZUNIONSTORE tmp_gpa 1 idx:student:GPA WEIGHTS 1
SCARD idx:student
```
Then, divide the sum of GPAs by the number of students.
- Calculate Average Attendance:
```javascript
ZUNIONSTORE tmp_attendance 1 idx:student:attendance WEIGHTS 1
SCARD idx:student
```
Then, divide the sum of attendance percentages by the number of students.

Count Students by Grade:
```javascript
ZCOUNT idx:student:grade 9th 9th
ZCOUNT idx:student:grade 10th 10th
ZCOUNT idx:student:grade 11th 11th
ZCOUNT idx:student:grade 12th 12th
```
### Task 7: Filter
- Filter by Grade:
```javascript
ZRANGEBYSCORE idx:student:grade (10th 10th
```
- Filter by Range:
```javascript
ZRANGEBYSCORE idx:student:GPA 3.0 4.0
```
- Filter by Attendance:
```javascript
ZRANGEBYSCORE idx:student:attendance (90 +inf
```
### Task 8: Sort
- Sort by Name:
```javascript
ZRANGEBYLEX idx:student:name [a [z
```
- Sort by GPA
```javascript
ZREVRANGE idx:student:GPA 0 -1 WITHSCORES
```
### Task 9: Paginate
- Implement Pagination
```javascript
ZRANGE idx:student 0 9
```
### Task 10: Managing geospatial data
- Add student locations
```javascript
GEOADD idx:student:location longitude1 latitude1 student_id1 longitude2 latitude2 student_id2 ...
```
- Find students nearby
```javascript
GEORADIUS idx:student:location longitude latitude radius m
```
- Calculate average distance froma location
``` javascript
GEORADIUS idx:student:location longitude latitude radius m WITHDIST
```
- Filter students by distance
```javascript
GEORADIUS idx:student:location longitude latitude radius m COUNT count
```
- Sort students by distance
```javascript
GEORADIUS idx:student:location longitude latitude radius m SORT asc
```

### Task 11: Redis Access Controls and Permissions
- [Redis ACL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/acl/)
- [ACL Permissions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rc/security/access-control/data-access-control/configure-acls/)

- Get all users in the database
```javascript
acl users
```
- Create a user
```javascript
ACL SETUSER user1 on >12345 +@all ~* >* on >* +get ~* +set
```
- Authenticate with Username and Password:
```javascript
AUTH user1 12345
```
- Verify permissions on the username:
```javascript
ACL LIST username
```
- Giving user permissions to access certain keys
```javascript
ACL SETUSER user2 on >12345
```
```javascript
ACL SETUSER user2 on +@write ~student
```
Note: ACL does not directly control access to individual databases. Instead, it grants permissions for certain operations, such as read or write, across all databases.

To achieve the goal of restricting a user to only one or two databases, you can use a workaround by creating separate Redis instances or containers, each configured to use a different set of databases, and then grant access to the user accordingly.

## Caching in Redis

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov18gLo0Da8)

[Redis client side caching](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/client-side-caching/)

[Distributed Caching](https://redis.io/glossary/distributed-caching/)

### Using redis caching for faster query(Express.js + Redis)

1. Install node.js NPM 
2. Create a new folder/directory 'redis_cache_demo'
3. Inside the folder execute the following commands
   ```javascript
   npm init -y
   ```
   ```javascript
   npm install express redis 
   ```
   ```javascript
   npm install node-fetch@3.0.0
   ```
   ```javascript
   npm install nodemon
   ```
4. Start redis server using command line tools
   ```javascript
   brew start services redis-server
   ```
   OR
   ```javascript
   redis-server
   ```
5. In the folder 'redis_cache_demo'
   - In package.json add start script to add nodemon to keep the sever updated with changes.
   package.json
   ```javascript
    {
    "name": "redis-demo",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nodemon index.js"
    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
        "@redis/client": "^1.5.14",
        "express": "^4.19.2",
        "node-fecth": "^0.0.1-security",
        "node-fetch": "2.6.6",
        "nodemon": "^3.1.0",
        "redis": "^4.6.13"
    }
    }
   ```
   - create a file index.js and add the following code:

   ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const { createClient } = require('redis');
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');

    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5050;
    const REDIS_PORT = process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379;
    const client = createClient({ socket: { port: REDIS_PORT } });

    const app = express();

    app.get('/:username', getRepos);

    async function setResponse(username, problemsSolved, responseTime) {
    return `<h2>${username} has solved ${problemsSolved} problems on LeetCode</h2>
            <p>Server response time: ${responseTime} ms</p>`;
    }

    async function getRepos(req, res, next) {
    try {
        console.log('Fetching Data...');
        const { username } = req.params;
        const startTime = Date.now();

        await client.connect();
        const cachedData = await client.get(username);
        if (cachedData) {
        const problemsSolved = parseInt(cachedData);
        const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        const response = await setResponse(username, problemsSolved, responseTime);
        res.send(response);
        } else {
        const response = await fetch(`https://leetcode-api-faisalshohag.vercel.app/${username}`);
        const data = await response.json();
        const problemsSolved = data.totalSolved;
        await client.set(username, problemsSolved.toString(), { EX: 3600 });
        const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        const response2 = await setResponse(username, problemsSolved, responseTime);
        res.send(response2);
        }
        await client.quit();
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
    }
    }

    app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```
6. To run the application:
   ```javascript
   npm start
   ```
