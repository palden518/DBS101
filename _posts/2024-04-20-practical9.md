# Guided Session

## Database connection(Nodejs)

### Driver
-  Software that allows for communication between an application and a DBMS.
-  In MongoDB the driver works with the built in Node js BSON package to interact with the MongoDB server.

1. Create a new folder "MongoDB_Demo"
2. Inside the folder execute the command
   ```javascript
   npm init
   ```
   ```javascript
   npm install mongodb
   ```
3. Create a file "db_URI.js"
   - Inside the file add in your connection string
   - To get your connection string follow this [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/)
   - A connection string helps connect your mongodb server to your application.
  ```javascript
  //Connecting to MongoDB Atlas 
  // module.exports = uri =
  //"mongodb+srv://<dbuser>:<dbuserpassword><@<clustername>.fvzdga6.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<clustername>"
  
  // Connecting to local DB server
   module.exports = uri = 
   "mongodb://localhost:27017"
  ```
  Note: Get your own connection string, the connection string given above for mongodb atlas is a placeholder.
  
4. Create a file "server.js". Add the following lines of code to establish a database connection locally to your mongodb server or to mongodb atlas
  ```javascript
  const { MongoClient, ServerApiVersion } = require('mongodb');
  const uri = require("./atlas_local_URI")
  // Create a MongoClient with a MongoClientOptions object to set the Stable API version
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);
  
  //Connecting to database server

  const connectToDatabase = async() =>{
      try{
          await client.connect()
          console.log(`Connected to database server`)
      } catch(err){
          console.error(`Error connecting to the database ${err}`);
      }
  };
  async function run() {
    try {
      // Connect the client to the server	(optional starting in v4.7)
      await connectToDatabase();
      // Send a ping to confirm a successful connection
      const dbs = await client.db().admin().listDatabases()
      console.table(dbs.databases)
      console.log("Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!");
    } finally {
      // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
      await client.close();
    }
  }
  run().catch(console.dir);
  ```
  Note: For all database requests an application should use a single database instance/ mongo client.
  
5. Run your sever
   
   ```javascript
   node server.js
   ```


# Exercise

## Load the sample dataset and perform the following operations

1. Create database 'mflix'
2. Download sample mflix database files [here](https://github.com/neelabalan/mongodb-sample-dataset/tree/main/sample_mflix)
3. Create collections for all collection files downloaded from github
4. Perform the following operation
   - findOne()- display one comment
   - find()- display all comments
   - findandModify() - modify one comment to say "This movie rocks!"
   - updateOne() - add a new movie "The monk and the gun"
   - updateMany() - update all user passwords to be "hello"
   - deleteOne() - delet one user
   - projection: on any document retrieve certain fields
   - transaction - perform a transaction to add a new user "your_name" to the users collection
   - aggregation - perform aggregation to retrieve a list of theaters sorted based on name(ascending),located in California
   - indexing - Give an example query, then create a index to optimize the query. Perform explain on the query to show whether the index is being used.

Note: You should to perform find() operations to show that you have executed the operation sucessfully.
