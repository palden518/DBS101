# Guided Session

Example Database: PokeDB

## Task 1: 1NF
To ensure the pokeDB schema is in the first normal form (1NF), we need to ensure that each column contains atomic values and there are no repeating groups. 

Scenario: Suppose we want to store the names of the moves that each Pokemon can learn. If we create a column move_names in the pokemon table and store a comma-separated list of move names, it would violate 1NF.

To achieve 1NF, we need to create a separate table for moves and establish a many-to-many relationship between pokemon and moves.

```javascript
CREATE TABLE moves (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE pokemon_moves (
    pokemon_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES pokemon(id),
    move_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES moves(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (pokemon_id, move_id)
);
```

## Task 2: 2NF
To achieve the second normal form (2NF), the database must first be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

Scenario: In the pokemon_species table, the attributes evolves_from_species_id, evolution_chain_id, color_id, shape_id, habitat_id, gender_rate, capture_rate, base_happiness, is_baby, hatch_counter, has_gender_differences, growth_rate_id, forms_switchable, order, and conquest_order are not fully dependent on the primary key id. They might be dependent on a subset of the primary key or other non-key attributes.

To achieve 2NF, we need to decompose the pokemon_species table into multiple tables, each with a primary key on which all non-key attributes are fully dependent.

```javascript
CREATE TABLE species (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    identifier VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    generation_id INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE species_details (
    species_id INT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES species(id),
    evolves_from_species_id INT NULL,
    evolution_chain_id INT NOT NULL,
    color_id INT NOT NULL,
    shape_id INT NOT NULL,
    habitat_id INT NOT NULL,
    gender_rate INT NOT NULL,
    capture_rate INT NOT NULL,
    base_happiness INT NOT NULL,
    is_baby BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    hatch_counter INT NOT NULL,
    has_gender_differences BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    growth_rate_id INT NOT NULL,
    forms_switchable BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    "order" INT NOT NULL,
    conquest_order INT NULL
);
```

## Task 3: 3NF
The third normal form (3NF) requires that the database is in 2NF and that there are no transitive dependencies.

Scenario: After decomposing the pokemon_species table, there are no transitive dependencies in the schema, and all tables are already in 3NF.

## Task 4: BCNF
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a stricter version of 3NF, where every determinant must be a candidate key. 

Scenario: In the current schema, there are no apparent non-trivial functional dependencies between non-key attributes, so the schema is already in BCNF.

## Task 5: 4NF
Fourth Normal Form (4NF) deals with multi-valued dependencies. 

Scenario: In the current schema, there are no multi-valued dependencies, as each column represents a single attribute. Therefore, the schema is already in 4NF.

## Task 6: 5NF
Fifth Normal Form (5NF) pertains to the absence of join dependencies.

Scenario: In the current schema, there are no join dependencies hence the schema is already in 5NF. 

## Task 7: Testing functional dependency
Scenario: Let's test if the pokemon_types table has a functional dependency between type_id and slot.

```javascript
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT slot) = 1
FROM pokemon_types
GROUP BY type_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
If the query returns true, it means that for each type_id value, there is only one possible slot value, indicating a functional dependency.

## Task 8: BCNF Decomposition Algorithm
The BCNF decomposition algorithm involves decomposing a relation into multiple relations to ensure each relation is in BCNF. The algorithm is more complex and involves analyzing functional dependencies and determining whether any non-trivial functional dependencies violate BCNF. Then, the relation is decomposed to eliminate these violations.

Scenario: Suppose we have a table trainer with attributes trainer_id, name, age, hometown, team_id, and team_name. Here, team_name is dependent on team_id, but not on the candidate key trainer_id. This violates BCNF.

To decompose the relation into BCNF, we can create two tables:

```javascript
CREATE TABLE trainer (
    trainer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    hometown VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    team_id INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE team (
    team_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

## Task 9: 3NF Decomposition Algorithm

The 3NF decomposition algorithm involves decomposing a relation into multiple relations to ensure each relation is in 3NF. The process typically involves identifying transitive dependencies and creating new relations to eliminate them.

Scenario: Suppose we have a table pokemon_stats with attributes pokemon_id, stat_id, base_stat, effort, and stat_name. Here, stat_name is transitively dependent on pokemon_id through stat_id, which violates 3NF.

To decompose the relation into 3NF, we can create two tables:

```javascript
CREATE TABLE pokemon_stats (
    pokemon_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES pokemon(id),
    stat_id INT NOT NULL,
    base_stat INT NOT NULL,
    effort INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (pokemon_id, stat_id)
);

CREATE TABLE stats (
    stat_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    stat_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```
