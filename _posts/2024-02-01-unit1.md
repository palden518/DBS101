### 1.2 Purpose of Database Systems  
- ### Flat Files VS DBMS

| Feature             | Flat Files                                                 | Database Management Systems                                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data structure      | No formal structure, data stored in text files             | Formally defined logical structure with relations between entities       |
| Data redundancy     | High potential for data redundancy                         | Minimizes data redundancy through normalization                          |
| Access control      | Minimal to none                                            | Sophisticated mechanisms for access control and permissions              |
| Concurrency control | None, which can cause issues with simultaneous user access | Concurrency control methods to enable simultaneous access without issues |
| Data integrity      | No enforcement of integrity constraints                    | Integrity constraints protect data accuracy and consistency              |
| Query capabilities  | None or limited to manual scans of entire file             | Powerful query language (SQL) enables complex queries                    |
| Data security       | Minimal protections beyond file system permissions         | Advanced security features like encryption and authentication            |
| Scalability         | Not scalable as data volumes grow                          | Highly scalable into very large data sets                                |
| Backup & recovery   | Manual backup and recovery                                 | Automated backup, recovery and replication features                      |
